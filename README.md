My partner's and my files are in `chess/`. They are all files except for `PlayChess.java`, `ReturnPiece.java` and `ReturnPlay.java`.

The remaining three files are added to allow the game to run. The submission required us to remove files we did not edit. Therefore, all files that were edited by me and my partner are in `chess.zip`. An easy way to tell which files we wrote is to look inside the `chess.zip` file. And an easy way to run the game locally is to download the chess folder and run the program within the folder.

All info and details are in the [project description](https://saleemshahdi.github.io/Portfolio/ProjectDescriptions/Chess/Chess.html). Opening the link in another tab can be better for navigability.
